# SecureText
This is a utility I made mainly for myself. I designed it to be literally the easiest thing in the world to use. You download the jar, throw it in the directory of your encrypted text files, and double click to to make it go. Just give it a try. It's hard to not figure out how it works. Relies on Jasypt. If you just want to use this, the standalone jar is found in the "store" directory.
